2. Batch scaling tools
3. Recipe save/load functionality

### Phase 2 (Medium Impact, Medium Complexity)
1. Fermentation timeline tracker
2. Yeast strain recommendations
3. Acid/pH balance calculator

### Phase 3 (High Impact, High Complexity)
1. Advanced calculators (blending, carbonation)
2. Recipe database with sharing
3. Mobile app development

## Technical Considerations
